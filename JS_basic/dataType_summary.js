// the 2 ways in which the data store and access in memory like call by function/call by Reference  
//#Premitive   (call by Value) it means whenever you use it data it will be as copy not actuall reference then every changes will be copy 

//Also JavaScript is a dynamically typed language because we didn't provide its type like String

//7-types:
//String, Number, boolean, bigInt, Symbol, undefined,null

const id=Symbol("123")
const anotherID=Symbol("123")

// console.log(id==anotherID);


//#NonPremitive (Reference Type)
//Array, Objects and functions


const data =["phislosophy", "marval", 123, true]


// console.log(data[0]);

let myObj={
    name: "Ahmer",
    age: "27",
    city:"Multan"    
}

// console.log(myObj["name"]);


let ahm= function(){


}

//if you want to become a JS expert then you need to know the JS Objects and web events
